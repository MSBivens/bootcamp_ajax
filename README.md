# Bootcamp - AJAX Course
This is a collection of code for the Coding Dojo Bootcamp, AJAX course assignments. This course was the fifth of the Python stack.

The previous stack was Flask + MySQL, the repo for those assignments can be found here: https://github.com/MSBivens/bootcamp_flask_mysql 

I am currently working through this course.
